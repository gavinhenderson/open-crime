# Open-Crime API

This API is a graphql wrapper around the API provided by at [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk)

## Running the API

First you want to install all the dependencies by running

```bash
$ npm i
```

Then you want to build the docs and start the server which can be done by running:

```bash
$ npm start
```

## GraphiQL and Docs

Once you have the server running you can then go to `localhost:8000/graphql` to get the GraphIQL interface and you can go to `localhost:8000/docs` to get the generated docs.
