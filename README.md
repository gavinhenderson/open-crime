# open-crime

A GraphQL based API for all of the crime stats available through the [data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/) API with a simple react app to show the stats

## API To-Dos

- Write some tests
- Look into code duplication
- Investigate a proxy route for things where the url is static (forces, last updated)
- All routes need error handling
